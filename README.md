## What this project is about
This is my own attempt at the Acasus's coding challenge. The task is to create a simpe CRUD application. I use React and Redux to create contact management app (like address book). I use [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) data for the contacts: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users


## Run it locally ðŸ–¥

Clone the repository.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/vanyadelova/contact-app.git
```
Install project dependencies and start the app.

```
cd contact-app
npm install
npm start
```

Your browser should automatically open localhost:3000 Enjoy the app!
